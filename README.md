# Advent of Code 2023
Advent of Code is a yearly coding competition that releases a puzzle daily at midnight EST. This year, I am challenging myself
to do each problem as quickly as possible in JavaScript.

## How to use repository
1. To install/update dependencies: `npm i`
2. To run a specific day: `node src/day1.js`
    - Modify the number after the day to whichever you'd like. There are 25 days.
